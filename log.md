# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 and 3/4 of Basic CSS on freecodecamp.org.  I started creating a contact page for dotnetMomma site I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** Most of the information was review.  There were a few points that were new to me or I had forgotten.  1)  You can set the margin to a negative value.  2)  You can select an attribute in CSS  [type='radio'] { }.   3)  You can use !important in CSS to make sure a style will override all other styles applied to a selector.

### Day 2:  September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Basic CSS and halfway through Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.org.  

**Thoughts:** Things that I practiced to get a better understanding of were box-shadow, text-transform, font-weight, position: relative,
position: absolute, position: fixed, float, z-index, margin: auto.  I did some coding practice with those concepts and played with the webpage me and my daughter started working on.  We added a box-shadow to the images, changed the banner image, colors of the header and put a background image on the main content area.

**Link to work:** None today having issues with GitHub Desktop pushing the work I've committed.


### Day 3:  September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Continued work on Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.org.  

**Thoughts:** Things that I practiced to get a better understanding of colors, finding complementary colors, changing the hue hsl, gradients (linear-gradient/repeating-linear-gradient) and setting the background image.  I had a question about what the difference between background and background-image.  According to w3schools background is just shorthand for background-image and other background settings in css.

**Link to work:** None today still having issues pushing from GitHub desktop.  Will have to look at it next week.

### Day 4:  September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to make a heart with CSS and transforms on #freecodecamp.  Did a few lessons on #edX HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals.  

**Thoughts:** Did some practice with transforms: scale, skewX, skewY, rotate, ::after, ::before.  Some of the lessons on edX HTML5 for article, section left me with some questions.  When should I use them and it differs from what I've learned so far on freecodecamp and Prograte which uses divs instead of article and section.  

**Link to work:** None today.

### Day 5 & 6:  September 16 - 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Learned about transforms and animations.  I completed the Applied Visual Design section of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I worked on this while on vacation so I didn't have a lot of time to practice.  I practiced working with animations and transforms.  I was going to add some animations to my dotnetmomma project.

**Link to work:** None today.

### Day 7:  September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Applied Accessibility on freecodecamp, almost completed Module 2 on edX HTML5 & CSS and day 1 of Intro to JavaScript on MomsCanCode.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have time to practice all of the concepts covered today.  I will do some practice on the concepts covered tomorrow and make changes to dotnetmomma project to apply the concepts.

**Link to work:** None today.
