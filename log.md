# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 and 3/4 of Basic CSS on freecodecamp.org.  I started creating a contact page for dotnetMomma site I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** Most of the information was review.  There were a few points that were new to me or I had forgotten.  1)  You can set the margin to a negative value.  2)  You can select an attribute in CSS  [type='radio'] { }.   3)  You can use !important in CSS to make sure a style will override all other styles applied to a selector.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
