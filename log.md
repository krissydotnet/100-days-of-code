# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 and 3/4 of Basic CSS on freecodecamp.org.  I started creating a contact page for dotnetMomma site I'm working on.

**Thoughts:** Most of the information was review.  There were a few points that were new to me or I had forgotten.  1)  You can set the margin to a negative value.  2)  You can select an attribute in CSS  [type='radio'] { }.   3)  You can use !important in CSS to make sure a style will override all other styles applied to a selector.

### Day 2:  September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Basic CSS and halfway through Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.org.  

**Thoughts:** Things that I practiced to get a better understanding of were box-shadow, text-transform, font-weight, position: relative,
position: absolute, position: fixed, float, z-index, margin: auto.  I did some coding practice with those concepts and played with the webpage me and my daughter started working on.  We added a box-shadow to the images, changed the banner image, colors of the header and put a background image on the main content area.

**Link to work:** None today having issues with GitHub Desktop pushing the work I've committed.
